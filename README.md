#  Computational Mechanics and Materials Research (CMMR) Laboratory at Michigan Techological Univerity
The CMMR Laboratory at Michigan Tech is devoted to using computational simulation to

 1. Predict the performance of materials
 2. Design materials to meet specific requirements
 3. Gain physical insight into material behavior

The CMMR team uses state-of-the-art computational tools to achieve these goals, including Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics, and Finite Element Analysis. 

# Main purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to distribute the LUNAR Python package for pre-processing and post-processing LAMMPS inputs and outputs. LUNAR is under active development with new releases every few months.

#  Computational Mechanics and Materials Research (CMMR) Laboratory at Michigan Techological Univerity
The CMMR Laboratory at Michigan Tech is devoted to using computational simulation to

 1. Predict the performance of materials
 2. Design materials to meet specific requirements
 3. Gain physical insight into material behavior

The CMMR team uses state-of-the-art computational tools to achieve these goals, including Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics, and Finite Element Analysis.
